# modCalc
Calculates range(0-x) mod y &amp; displays each valid x in binary form.

I made this quick script to make my life a little easier. I had a homework problem that asked:
"For an alphabet {0,1}, draw a DFA representing modulo 3 operations (The DFA only accepts strings divisible by 3 (e.g., 0,11,etc.))"

Essentially, I wanted to identify all the x's that satisfy x mod 3 = 0 and visualize the binary of each in order to see 
if I could identify a pattern that could enable me to draw the DFA.
